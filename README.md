# BrandFeelingFrontEnd

Representation of the front end system on Brand Feeling old version, it is responsible for receiving the user input, call the processing unit and then show the results.

This code doesn't RUN, it has some of the system data, other parts of the code were ommited to maintaint the system's privacy

Folders:

 - Ajax: Contains the PHP that solves the angular calls, and repass it to each class.
 - classes : Containts the system class, most of the data here were ommited.
 - Visual: containts the system's views, the visual libraries as well as the angularjs files. 
 
Once the user makes a search the front end calls the redundancy system (https://github.com/jrCoppi/BrandFeelingRedundancy) that will deal with the backend of the application (https://github.com/jrCoppi/BrandFeelingBackEnd) and retrive the data.
